          ><b>Mayon Volcano</b></a
        >, located in Albay, Philippines, is renowned for its near-perfect cone
        shape, making it one of the most iconic volcanoes in the world. Towering
        at 2,462 meters (8,077 feet), Mayon is an active stratovolcano with a
        history of frequent eruptions, some of which have caused devastation to
        nearby communities. Despite its fiery nature, Mayon is a major tourist
        attraction, drawing visitors who admire its breathtaking symmetry and
        the lush landscape that surrounds it. The volcano is part of the Mayon
        Volcano Natural Park, home to rich biodiversity, scenic trails, and
        stunning viewpoints that offer a glimpse of its majestic presence.

        Beyond its geological significance, Mayon is deeply intertwined with
        local culture and folklore. The most famous legend tells the tragic love
        story of Daragang Magayon, a beautiful maiden whose name means
        "beautiful lady" in the Bicolano language. According to the tale, the
        volcano was formed from her grave, symbolizing eternal beauty and
        sorrow. Today, Mayon continues to be both a source of awe and caution,
        as its eruptions remind locals of nature’s power. Nevertheless, it
        remains a symbol of resilience and beauty, standing as a testament to
        the Philippines’ rich natural and cultural heritage.
